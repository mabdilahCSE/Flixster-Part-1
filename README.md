# Project *Flixster*

By: **Mohamed Abdilahi**

**Flixster** allows users to discover new movies, read general movie description, and see how popular it is among other users with popularity trackers and other metadata. In hopes to emulate some of Flixster's functionality I used hardcoded Movie data models to display mocked data using this [JSON][https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/now_playing?api_key=a07e22bc18f5cb106bfe4cc1f83ad8ed] to get movie informations. 

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total
